This repository is an **Eleventy template** based on **Tailwind CSS**.

The template main purpose is mainly for form building. Forms are built by using reusable components, which are Eleventy shortcodes 🍰.

The idea is to build form from JSON input. JSON can be static files, markdown frontmatter, or API request during build process.
